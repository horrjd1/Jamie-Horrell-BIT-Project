1.2
I decided to join the Web Development group because that is the field that I believe I am best at and have enjoyed the most throughout the last couple years. I had been put into a team with two people I had never met before, Trent and Liam who were currently in Project 2 and have been working on the site for half a year already. So, we started with introductions.
After that they showed me the site that they were going to be continuing development on this semester. A site that has taken data from the New York Times and displays graphs that show word frequency and __________other variations. This looked very interesting to me and I look forward to working on this project from here on (even though the amount of new software/languages/tools I would have to learn is very daunting and I can tell that it will be a while before I can start making addictions/changes to the site without assistance).

2.1
The main purpose of this lesson was to get the project set up and working on my computer. My teammates had explained all of the software that they were using to create the site and since I wasnâ€™t familiar with a lot of the stuff the setup used (like docker and the pickle files for the models) I had to get them to run me through it which they were happy to do. They had an installation tutorial on the Gitlab wiki but it was designed for Linux users so we were also double checking that the tutorial would work for a windows machine. It worked for the most part but there was a problem with the line ending on some on some files that were throwing up errors.
Since I had no experience with any of the languages/tools used in the project I got assigned with a ReactJS tutorial from my teammates. This was the official tutorial from the reactjs site where you crated a game of noughts and crosses. I completed this tutorial as well as did some more revision on it in my own time in the following days.

Wednesday 26
Before I met back with the team on Thursday I decided to spend more time reading through the groups wiki page/documentation. I reviewed a lot of their methodologies and practices when it comes to the git repo, sprints and folder structure. Things such as:
How the structure of the project is feature by folder
Pull requests must adhere to a review checklist and be reviewed by one person
Commits are in future tense 
Etc
This would mean that I know what to expect when meeting with my team tomorrow. 

2.2 
Completed the reactJS tutorial
At this point I was still experiencing issues with docker that was preventing me from running the site on my machine so I got Liams help to fix these issues. Because of how I learnt the way they name/handle git commits/pull requests I was able to make my first commit/pull request while adhering to their naming conventions/tests
