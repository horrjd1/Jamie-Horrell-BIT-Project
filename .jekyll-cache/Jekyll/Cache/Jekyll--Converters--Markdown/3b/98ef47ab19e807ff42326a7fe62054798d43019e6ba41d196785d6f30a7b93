I"€<p>I decided to join the Web Development group because that is the field that I believe I am best at and have enjoyed doing the most throughout the last couple years. I had been put into a team with two people I had never met before, Trent and Liam who were currently in Project 2 and have been working on the site for half a year already. So, we started with introductions.
After that they showed me the site that they were going to be continuing development on this semester. A site that has taken data from the New York Times and displays graphs that show word frequency variations. This looked very interesting to me and I look forward to working on this project from here on (even though the amount of new software/languages/tools I would have to learn is very daunting and I can tell that it will be a while before I can start making addictions/changes to the site without assistance).</p>
