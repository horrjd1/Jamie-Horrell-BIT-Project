<p>I had been tasked with removing the Topic Modelling and Sentiment Analysis sections from the site as they either werenâ€™t completed (made by students from the previous semester who have since left) or arenâ€™t working correctly/up to standard. This required me to know/understand the basic structure of the project in order to find what to remove as well as the knowledge on how ReactJS handle routes. I did this with Liams supervision just to make sure that what I was doing was correct.</p>

<p>It was also at this point that I was taught more about how they tested their project before making pull requests so using the commands</p>
<ul>
  <li>Npm I -D</li>
  <li>Npm run tests</li>
</ul>

<p>On the second lesson Trent and Liam got me to write a test for the user authentication they had just finished. Which was great as, though im unable to write code to for a authentication system for the site, it allowed to go through what theyâ€™ve done and understand</p>
