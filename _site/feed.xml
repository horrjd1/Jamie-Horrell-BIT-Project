We were mainly focused on restructuring the file system of the site as it was becoming quite convoluted and repetitive. We also thought that a new structure may be easier to grasp for new students coming into the project in future semesters. We also decided on a structure for the database. Pictures from the brainstorm are below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been tasked with removing the Topic Modelling and Sentiment Analysis sections from the site as they either weren’t completed (made by students from the previous semester who have since left) or aren’t working correctly/up to standard. This required me to know/understand the basic structure of the project in order to find what to remove as well as the knowledge on how ReactJS handle routes. I did this with Liams supervision just to make sure that what I was doing was correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also at this point that I was taught more about how they tested their project before making pull requests so using the commands&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Npm I -D&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Npm run tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second lesson Trent and Liam got me to write a test for the user authentication they had just finished. Which was great as, though im unable to write code to for a authentication system for the site, it allowed to go through what they’ve done and understand&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">PostMan</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">First 2 Weeks</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2020/03/01/first-2-weeks.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="First 2 Weeks" /><published>2020-03-01T18:49:08+13:00</published><updated>2020-03-01T18:49:08+13:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2020/03/01/first-2-weeks</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2020/03/01/first-2-weeks.html">&lt;p&gt;I decided to join the Web Development group because that is the field that I believe I am best at and have enjoyed doing the most throughout the last couple years. I had been put into a team with two people I had never met before, Trent and Liam who were currently in Project 2 and have been working on the site for half a year already. So, we started with introductions.
After that they showed me the site that they were going to be continuing development on this semester. A site that has taken data from the New York Times and displays graphs that show word frequency variations. This looked very interesting to me and I look forward to working on this project from here on (even though the amount of new software/languages/tools I would have to learn is very daunting and I can tell that it will be a while before I can start making addictions/changes to the site without assistance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;week-2---mon&quot;&gt;Week 2 - Mon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of this session was to get the project set up and working on my computer. My teammates had given a brief overview of the software they were using to create the site and since I wasn’t familiar with a lot it(like docker and the pickle files for the models) I had to get them to run me through it which they were happy to do. They had an installation tutorial on the Gitlab wiki but it was designed for Linux users so we were also double checking that the tutorial would work for a windows machine. It worked for the most part but there was a problem with the line ending on some files that were throwing up errors.
Since I had no experience with any of the languages/tools used in the project I got assigned with a ReactJS tutorial from my teammates. This was the official tutorial from the reactjs site where you crated a game of noughts and crosses. I completed this tutorial as well as did some more revision on it in my own time in the following days since the way the official tutorial taught didnt stick with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;week-2---wednesday&quot;&gt;Week 2 - Wednesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I met back with the team on Thursday I decided to spend more time reading through the groups wiki page/documentation. I reviewed a lot of their methodologies and practices when it comes to the git repo, sprints and folder structure. Things such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How the structure of the project is feature by folder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pull requests must adhere to a review checklist and be reviewed by one person&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Commits are in future tense&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would mean that I know what to expect when meeting with my team tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;week-2---thursday&quot;&gt;Week 2 - Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I was still experiencing issues with docker that was preventing me from running the site on my machine so I got Liams help to fix these issues. This also marked the first commit/pull request I could make to the site. The studying from the previous night came in handy as I was able to adhere to their naming conventions/tests.&lt;/p&gt;
