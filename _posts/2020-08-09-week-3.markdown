# Testing the API

Nic and I both followed this tutorial where we used POSTMAN to log into our companies Xero account using the OAuth workflow to receive data from the API.

https://developer.xero.com/documentation/tools/postman

This OAuth process involved:
- sending an authorization request to Xero to receive an Authorization code
- sending the authorization code to receive an access token
- sending the access token to receive the tenant id
- sending the tenant id and access token to receive the required data from the API

Here are some screenshots of the process:

# Gulp

I had previously wanted to use material UI in our site as it had similar benefits to bootstrap but would work much more nicely with a react front end. However, this required us to have node modules installed. 

Since ASP.NET doesn't have the same folder structure and features of a Node project, I needed a way to make the node_module folder accessible to the site. To do this I learned the basics of Gulp in order to make a script to copy the node_modules into the wwwroot folder.

```javascript
var gulp = require("gulp");

function copy_node_modules(cb) {
    return gulp
        .src("node_modules/**")
        .pipe(gulp.dest('wwwroot/node_modules'));

    cb();
}

exports.copy_node_modules = copy_node_modules;
exports.default = copy_node_modules;
```

However, after doing some research into doing this we discovered that copying all the node modules into a public folder could be a security risk and that if we were to continue to add node modules we would have to continuously run and modify this script. So we decided to move to a different UI framework at least for the time being. So even though we aren't using it currently in the project, I still got a little bit of experience with Gulp.
