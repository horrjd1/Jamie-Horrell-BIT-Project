# Testing the API

we followed this tutorial where we used POSTMAN to log into our 'companys' Xero account using access tokens.

Here are some screenshots of the process:

# Gulp

We had previously wanted to use material UI in our site ____. however this required us to have node modules installed. 
Since asp.net doesnt have the same folder structure and features of an asp.net project, we needed a way to make the node_module 
accessable. In order to do this we learnt gulp in order to make a script to copy the node_modules into the wwwroot folder.

```javascript
var gulp = require("gulp");

function copy_node_modules(cb) {
    return gulp
        .src("node_modules/**")
        .pipe(gulp.dest('wwwroot/node_modules'));

    cb();
}

exports.copy_node_modules = copy_node_modules;
exports.default = copy_node_modules;
```

However after doing some research into doing this we discovered that copying all the node modules into a public folder could be a security risk, and that 
if we were to continue to add node modules we would have to continously modify this script. So we decided to move to a different ui framework. So even though we arent using it currently in the project, we still learnt gulp.
