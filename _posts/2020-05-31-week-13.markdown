# Prop Types

It had been a while since I had done the react tutorial back at the start of the semester so I ahd to do a refresher with how proptypes work so that I could implement them into the csv download button component that I made. This is to make sure that the correct types of data 

```
class CsvDownloadButton extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { classes } = this.props
    return (
      <TooltipUI title="Download as csv" placement="right" arrow>
        <Fab color="secondary" aria-label="download" className={classes.fab}>
          <CSVLink data={this.props.data} headers={this.props.headers} filename={this.props.filename}>
            <GetAppIcon fontSize="large" className={classes.icon}/>
          </CSVLink>
        </Fab>
      </TooltipUI>
    );
  }
}
```

```
CsvDownloadButton.propTypes = {
  data: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.object).isRequired,
  headers: PropTypes.arrayOf((PropTypes.object)).isRequired,
  filename: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
};
```

# Questions

Since it was coming close to the end of the semester I had prepared a list of questions covering some of the things that I havent touched this semester in regards to the project. I thought that it would be important to have an understanding of these things before Trent and Liam left the project. Some of my questions included:
- How did you set up Travis ci to run on pull requests and how is that managed?
- Where did you set up the issue templates
- What are the storybook folders used for and how do they work
- how were the docs generated

etc
