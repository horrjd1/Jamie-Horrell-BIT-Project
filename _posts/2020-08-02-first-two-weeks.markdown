# A Change in Project

When I got back into Project this semester I got informed about a lot of stuff that has been going on in the background of my previous project over the break. I don't know if I should write about all that here but our old project was in a bad state and most parts would have had to of been rebuilt. At the time it also didn't look like anyone was going to join the project and that I was going to be the only member of a team working on it. I got offered by a group of studio 5 students to join them as they were starting a new web project and needed one more member. So after talking to Trent (One of my previous project members who had done work on it over the break) and David, I made the decision to change projects, in order to learn more web technologies and work in a team with other students.

# First Two Weeks

We mostly spent the first two weeks getting familiar with what we were going to be working on and started setting up the AWS server to contain our deployed work.

### Communication

We set up a teams group for us to communicate on with various channels for meetings, resources, issue help etc. This would be our primary way of communicating out side of Polytech.

### Setting up the ASP.NET project

To get an ASP.NET project set up I followed this tutorial:

https://reactjs.net/tutorials/aspnetcore.html

However during the later parts, it just turned into a React tutorial, and I was already familiar with react from Webc3 and my last Project. Since this tutorial didn't talk very much about what ASP.NET is I did my own research into it, mainly looking at Microsoft resources and docs such as:

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/aspnet/what-is-aspnet

### AWS

Nic and I spent most of our time during project hours setting up the AWS server. We worked together following this tutorial I found to get the ubuntu VM set up:

https://odan.github.io/2018/07/17/aspnet-core-2-ubuntu-setup.html

We then deployed the default ASP.NET project that I had created from the tutorial to check that our deployment had worked and was publically visible.

### Xero

We also made an account on Xero and created a demo company.
