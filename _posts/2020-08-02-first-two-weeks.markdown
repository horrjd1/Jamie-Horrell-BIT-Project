# A Change in Project

When I got back to project this semester had been informed about alot of the stuff that has been happening in the background of our project over the break. I dont know if I should write about all that here but our old project was in a bad state and most parts would have had to of been rebuilt. At the time it also didnt look like anyone was going to join the project and that I was going to be the only member of a team working on it. I got offered by a group of studio 5 students to join them as they were starting a new web project and needed 1 more member. So after talking to Trent (old project member who had done some work on it over the break) and David I made the decision to change projects, in order to learn more web technologies and work in a team with other students.

# First Two Weeks

We mostly spent the first two weeks getting familair with what we were going to be working on and setting up the AWS server to contain our deployed work.

### Setting up the ASP.NET project

To get and ASP.NET project set up I followed this totorial:

https://reactjs.net/tutorials/aspnetcore.html

However during the later parts it just turned into a React tutorial, and I am already familar with react from Web3 and my last Project. Since this tutorial didnt talk very much about what ASP.NET is I did my own research into it, mainly looking at Micorsoft resources and docs such as 

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/aspnet/what-is-aspnet

### AWS

Nic and I doent most of our time during project hours setting up the AWS server.

We then deployed my default project that I had created from the tutorial to check that it worked.

### Xero

We also spent a little bit of time looking into what Xero is and what their API provides
