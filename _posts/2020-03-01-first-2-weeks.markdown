I decided to join the Web Development group because that is the field that I am most personally interested in and have enjoyed doing the most throughout the last couple years. I had been put into a team with two people I had never met before, Trent and Liam who were currently in Project 2 and have been working on the site for half a year already. So, we started with introductions.
After that they showed me the site that they were going to be continuing development on this semester. A site that has taken articles from the New York Times and displays graphs that show word frequency and other variations. This looked very interesting to me and I look forward to working on this project from here on (even though the amount of new software/languages/tools I would have to learn is very daunting and I already can tell that it will be a while before I can start making addictions/changes to the site without assistance).

### Week 2 - Mon
The main purpose of this session was to get the project set up and working on my computer. My teammates had given a brief overview of the software they were using to create the site and since I wasnâ€™t familiar with a lot it(like docker and the pickle files for the models) I had to get them to run me through it which they were happy to do. They had an installation tutorial on the Github wiki but it was designed for Linux users so we were also double checking that the tutorial would work for a windows machine. It worked for the most part but there was a problem with the line ending on some files that were throwing up errors.
Since I had no experience with any of the languages/tools used in the project I got assigned with a ReactJS tutorial from my teammates. This was the official tutorial from the ReactJS site where you created a game of noughts and crosses. I completed this tutorial as well as did some more revision on ReactJS in my own time during the following days since the way the official tutorial taught didn't really stick with me.

### Week 2 - Wednesday
Before I met back with the team on Thursday I decided to spend more time reading through the groups wiki page/documentation. I reviewed a lot of their methodologies and practices when it comes to the git repo, sprints and folder structure. Things such as:
- How the structure of the project is feature by folder
- Pull requests must adhere to a review checklist and be reviewed by one person
- Commits are in future tense
- Etc

This would mean that I know what to expect when meeting with my team tomorrow.

### Week 2 - Thursday
At this point I was still experiencing issues with docker that was preventing me from running the site on my local machine so I got Liams help to fix these issues. This also marked the first commit/pull request I could make to the site. The studying from the previous night came in handy as I was able to adhere to their naming conventions/tests.
