# Scrum

At the start of the week our team held a scrum for Sprint 8. This meeting mainly focused on brainstorming a revised file structure for the site as it was becoming quite convoluted and repetitive. We also thought that a new structure may be easier to grasp for new students coming into the project in future semesters aswell as myself to work on. We also decided on a rough structure for the database. Pictures from the brainstorm are below. We also decided that we would use this sprint to add more data sources as per the clients request and add some options to the graphs (filtering).

# Site Restructure

For this sprint I was assigned with restructuring the file system of the site into what we had decided during our scrum meeting on monday. Doing this furthered my understanding of the structure of the site and what each part is doing. In order to achieve this I also had to change the routes for a lot of files as well as update the snapshots. I had Trent and Liams assistance for this since most of it was completely new to me and they gave me some quick explanations for what each section does.

# Cors

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. My team had previously set up the resources to use CORS on the site but weren't using it, so I was tasked with making the new express backend use it. I started by doing some research into what CORS is and how it works in my own time. Once I understood what I had to complete I added the following into the back-ends app.js file.
```
var app = express()
```
and
```
app.use(cors())
```
 The rest was set up by Trent and Liam previously but I still had to review to understand what it was doing.
