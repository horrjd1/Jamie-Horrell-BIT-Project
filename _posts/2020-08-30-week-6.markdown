# CRUD

To test that the database was working I quickly set up some CRUD pages using Visual Studios scaffolding feature. This quickly created some models and pages that I could use to display the students that were in the database on a webpage, and of course edit and delete them.

For example here is the page responsible for displaying the create student dialog:

```html
@model NJXManagement.Models.Student

@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Create";
}

<h1>Create</h1>

<h4>Student</h4>
<hr />
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <form asp-action="Create">
            <div asp-validation-summary="ModelOnly" class="text-danger"></div>
            <div class="form-group">
                <label asp-for="LastName" class="control-label"></label>
                <input asp-for="LastName" class="form-control" />
                <span asp-validation-for="LastName" class="text-danger"></span>
            </div>
            <div class="form-group">
                <label asp-for="FirstName" class="control-label"></label>
                <input asp-for="FirstName" class="form-control" />
                <span asp-validation-for="FirstName" class="text-danger"></span>
            </div>
            <div class="form-group">
                <input type="submit" value="Create" class="btn btn-primary" />
            </div>
        </form>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <a asp-action="Index">Back to List</a>
</div>

@section Scripts {
    @{await Html.RenderPartialAsync("_ValidationScriptsPartial");}
}
```

# Components presets

I was also looking for CSS templates or react component templates that we could use on our site as this would save us a lot of development time specifically when it came to styling. I didn't manage to find any fantastic CSS frameworks that would match the content that we were trying to create, but I did manage to find a React component framework called Tabler which has components that look very similar to those used in Xeros admin dashboard.
