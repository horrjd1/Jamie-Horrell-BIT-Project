# Clean up Project

Dont know if this needs to be said but every week or two I have been cleaning up the repo by closing issues that have been completed or updating issues that arent accurate with our current plans anymore etc.

# Removing client id and secret from git flow

It was during this week that I caught that our client id and client secret from our appsettings.json file were in our git repo. This was bad practice and to solve it I removed those specific codes from file, and uploaded a version with placeholder information that should be filled out by the developer on theor local machine. I then created a wiki page in our teams chat that would hold all the confidetial passwords and codes for our application.
