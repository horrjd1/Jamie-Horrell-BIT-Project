# Database Connection

A challenge I came across this week was connecting the SQL Server project I had created last week with our ASP.NET project. Most tutorials I could find about how to do this expected the project to able to create and use ADO.NET files (ADO.NET is a framework designed to interact with data sources, like databases and XML files). However, our project was unable to create or use any of these types of files. I suspect that this is because the project was created as a .NET standard project instead of a .NET framework. as the correct tools in Visual Studio were installed and Entity Framework was installed via NuGet.

Since this wasn't an option I had to approach connecting to the database manually. To do this I created a connection string in the appsettings.json file:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {	 
"DatabaseContext": "Server=(localdb)\\ProjectsV13;Initial Catalog=NJXDatabase;Integrated Security=True;Trusted_Connection=True;"	 
 },
```

I could then set up a DataBaseContext Class that gets used in the Startup.cs file that will connect to the database:

DatabaseContext.cs
```C#
namespace NJXManagement.Data
{
    public class DatabaseContext : DbContext
    {
        public DatabaseContext(
            DbContextOptions<DatabaseContext> options)
            : base(options)
        {
        }

        public DbSet<Student> Student { get; set; }
    }
}

```

Startup.cs
```C#
services.AddDbContext<DatabaseContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("databaseContext")));
```
