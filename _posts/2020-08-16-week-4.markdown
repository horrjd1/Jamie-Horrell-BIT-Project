# Authentication

Both Me and Nic were working together on integrating Xeros OAuth2 samples into out MVC Project.

# Database

At the end of the week while Nic was fixing an issue with the OAuth in our project I started work on setting up a database. I created a SQL Server Database Project that would run alongside our Xero application. At this point we were still unsure of what the database was going to be used for, so I created dummy sql files that would create some small tables on students, courses and enrolments as well as a Script.PostDeployment1.sql script that would populate the tables. These should come in handy when we need to use the database as they would be a good reference point.
