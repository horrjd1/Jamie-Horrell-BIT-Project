# Break Plan

Both I and my team member prepared a 'meeting' to discuss how we would work over the break. We broke up the work evenly and based on when each of us would be able to work on the site. We decided that I was going to make a demo dashboard and potentially other pages for the site while waiting for Nic to finish the login less (no action required by the end-user) Xero connection. once that was finished we could then integrate the API into each of the already made components.

# Communication

We made sure to communicate on teams regularly to keep up to date on what each other were doing, having a voice meeting when there was more to discuss. Here's some evidence of that:

# Project Restructure

There were several problems that we were facing in our development
- Site wasn't live updating
- Modules we had created to load react modules onto a cshtml file weren't always working and were loading for the incorrect pages, this was also creating more work when making a page
- I was having trouble converting the cshtml identity login partial into a react component

After weighing up these options we decided that we would create a new project this time from the react template that would fix all the previously mentioned issues and move all our current content over to that new template. This was a very quick solution as most of the work was just moving some files across.

Once I had completed the transfer I made sure to teach my teammate the changes such as the renaming of the Client directory and how there were no more cshtml files for each page.

If anything this experience has taught me to go more in-depth into my options when starting something as it is a pain knowing that I spent a lot of time trying to set up npm and webpack into the project when a template could have done it instantly, but I refused because I didn't want to remake the project as its bad practice and wouldn't be possible in the future when the codebase is bigger.

# Grid

I wanted to make sure that the dashboard that I was making this week was responsive and formatted nicely onto whatever screen size was being used. In order to achieve this with the paper cards I had made to hold the charts, I decided to use the material UI grid component and add breakpoints for different screen sizes. This meant that if the screen's width was small enough the cards would form a single vertical column. 

```html
      <div className="component-grid">
        <Grid container spacing={3}>
          <Grid item sm={12} md={6}>
            <BusinessBankAccount/>
          </Grid>
          <Grid item sm={12} md={6}>
            <BusinessSavingsAccount/>
          </Grid>
        ...
```

# Charting Libraries

I made sure to look over and test multiple react charting libraries to see which would provide the most useful features for our site. I tested:

- recharts
- DevExtreme Charts
- react-chartjs-2

## recharts

I chose recharts because of its customizability, extensive documentation, and how lightweight it is. The documentation provided examples that could very easily be modified to incorporate our API.

Examples of code I used to make the charts that loaded external data:

```html
//
<ResponsiveContainer>
    <BarChart
        width={500}
        height={300}
        data={data}
        margin={{
          top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5,
        }}
    >
        <XAxis dataKey="name" />
        <Tooltip />
        <Legend />
        <Bar dataKey="in" fill="#68A3DE" />
        <Bar dataKey="out" fill="LightGray" />
    </BarChart>
</ResponsiveContainer>

<ResponsiveContainer>
    <AreaChart
        data={data}
        margin={{
            top: 10,
            right: 0,
            left: 0,
            bottom: 0,
        }}
    >
        <XAxis dataKey="name" />
        <Tooltip />
        <Area
            type="monotone"
            dataKey="Balance"
            fill="#0466c8"
        />
    </AreaChart>
</ResponsiveContainer>
```

Here is what the dashboard currently looks like:

# Git Maintenance

Probably doesn't need to be stated at this point but I am remaining to keep the git repo well maintained.

Keeping issues up to date, closing issues that weren't relevant anymore or were already finished, and adding new issues covering things that weren't added in pull requestss or that I noticed while working on the site, such as:

- [https://github.com/Marrnj2/XeroWebProject/issues/55](https://github.com/Marrnj2/XeroWebProject/issues/55)
- [https://github.com/Marrnj2/XeroWebProject/issues/54](https://github.com/Marrnj2/XeroWebProject/issues/54)

I continue to make pull requests as informative as I can, for example:

[https://github.com/Marrnj2/XeroWebProject/pull/56](https://github.com/Marrnj2/XeroWebProject/pull/56)
