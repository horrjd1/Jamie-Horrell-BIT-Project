# Other Focuses

I had alot of stuff going on at the end of this week so I didnt have as much time to work on project as I wanted.

# More Downloading

Now that the latent association association was back into the site, I could make the csv download function with the latent association. I did this in a similar way to the frequency.
```
const getDownloadData = (currentData, concept1, concept2) => {
  const dataToDownload = [];
  console.log(currentData)
  if(currentData) {
    currentData.forEach(item => {
      console.log(item)
      console.log(item["yearRange"])
      dataToDownload.push({
        mediaOutlet: mediaOutlets.find(obj => obj.value === item["media_outlet"]).name,
        concept1: concept1,
        concept2: concept2,
        yearRange: item["yearRange"],
        association: item["association"],
      });
    });
  }
  return dataToDownload;
};
```
```
  const dataToDownload = useMemo(() => getDownloadData(associations,concept1,concept2), [
    associations,
    concept1,
    concept2,
  ]);
```
I also made it so that the button isnt shown when there is no data on the page or if he user is currently editing the form:
```
formSubmitted && dataToDownload.length && !loading ? (
    <CsvDownloadButton
        data={dataToDownload}
        headers={csvHeaders}
        filename="ma-word-frequency.csv"
    />
) : (
    null
)}
```
